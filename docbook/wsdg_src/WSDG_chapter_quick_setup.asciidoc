== Quick Setup

[[ChSetupUNIX]]

=== UNIX: Installation

All the tools required are usually installed on a UNIX developer machine.

If a tool is not already installed on your system, you can usually install it
using the package in your distribution: aptitude, yum, Synaptic, etc.

If an install package is not available or you have a
reason not to use it (maybe because it's simply too old), you
can install that tool from source code. The following sections
will provide you with the webpage addresses where you can get
these sources.

[[ChSetupWin32]]

=== Win32/64: Step-by-Step Guide

A quick setup guide for Win32 and Win64 with recommended
configuration.

[WARNING]
====
Unless you know exactly what you are doing, you
should strictly follow the recommendations below.
====

[[ChSetupMSVC]]

==== Install Microsoft C compiler and SDK

You need to install, in exactly this order:

. C compiler:
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express[Download]
and install "Microsoft Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Express Edition." This is a very
large download.

. Windows SDK for Windows 7, if you want to build 64-bit binaries for Windows 7:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx[Download] and
install "Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7."
+
In case the install of the SDK fails go to software management and
remove the $$VC++$$ 2010 runtime and redist packages (don't worry, they
will be added back via the service pack later). If installation of
the SDK still fails, there may be a permission problem. See
http://ctrlf5.net/?p=184[here] for a solution.

. C compiler service pack:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691[Download] and
install "Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1." This is a very large
download.

. Microsoft Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows
SDK 7.1, if you want to build 64-bit binaries for Windows 7:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422[Download] and
install "Microsoft Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the
Windows SDK 7.1."

If you will be building 64-bit binaries those items must be
installed in that order as installing the Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 Service Pack 1 can, if you've installed the Microsoft Windows
SDK for Windows 7, remove the 64-bit compilers, as per
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2519277[the Microsoft Knowledge Base article "FIX: Visual C++ compilers are removed when you upgrade Visual Studio 2010 Professional or Visual Studio 2010 Express to Visual Studio 2010 SP1 if Windows SDK v7.1 is installed"].  The release notes for the Microsoft Visual
$$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1
say that, to ensure that your system has a supported
configuration, you must install the items in the order specified
above.  If you have Microsoft Update installed, so that the
Windows update process will update software other than components
of Windows, and thus will update Visual Studio, you may need to
disable it until after all of the above are installed, to make
sure it doesn't install Visual Studio 2010 SP1 out of order.

[TIP]
.You can use other Microsoft C compiler variants
====
It's possible to compile Wireshark with a wide range
of Microsoft C compiler variants. For details see
<<ChToolsMSChain>>!
====


[WARNING]
.Don't use gcc or Clang
====
Compiling with gcc or Clang is not recommended and will
certainly not work (at least without a lot of advanced
tweaking). For further details on this topic, see
<<ChToolsGNUChain>>.
====

// XXX - mention the compiler and PSDK web installers -
// which significantly reduce download size - and find out the
// required components

Why is this recommended? While this is a huge download,
the 2010 Express Edition is the only free (as in beer)
version that includes the Visual Studio integrated
debugger. Visual $$C++$$ 2010 is also used to create official
Wireshark builds, so it will likely have fewer development-related
problems.

[[ChSetupQt]]


==== Install Qt (optional but recommended)

If you wish to build QtShark (The Wireshark GUI using the Qt windowing
toolkit), http://qt-project.org/downloads[download] and install the appropriate
Qt libraries.

Note that the Qt package also includes the Qt Creator IDE, which may be useful
for designing graphical components, and includes an interactive debugger.
You'll need to build wireshark using nmake before you'll be able to build the
QtShark project (ui/qt/QtShark.pro), however.

[WARNING]
.Don't use the default full-package Qt installer
====
The default (suggested) full-package Qt installer is built with the MinGW
toolchain, which is not currently supported by Wireshark's build process on
Windows and so will not work.  Instead, you will want to use the installer for
the toolchain you are using (e.g. Qt <version> for Windows 32-bit (VS 2013,
OpenGL) if you are using the toolchain set up by these quick-start
instructions).
====

[TIP]
.Qt migration
====
As the GTK+ version of Wireshark is being deprecated in favor of the Qt
version, it is a good idea to build QtShark and ensure that any features that
you've added work in that version.
====


[[ChSetupCygwin]]

==== Install Cygwin

On 32-bit Windows, http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe[download the
32-bit Cygwin installer] and start it.  On 64-bit Windows,
http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe[download the 64-bit Cygwin
installer] and start it.

At the "Select Packages" page, you'll need to select
some additional packages which are not installed by default.
Navigate to the required Category/Package row and, if the package
has a "Skip" item in the "New" column, click on the "Skip" item
so it shows a version number for:

// Only used by win-setup.sh
* Archive/unzip

* Devel/bison (or install Win flex-bison - see Chocolatey below)

* Devel/flex (or install Win flex-bison - see Chocolatey below)

* Devel/git (recommended - see discussion about using Git below)

* Interpreters/perl

* Utils/patch (only if needed) (may be Devel/patch instead)

// Only used by win-setup.sh
* Web/wget

// Also need: bash/sh, sed

You might also have to install

* Interpreters/m4

if installing Devel/bison doesn't provide a working version of Bison. If
m4 is missing bison will fail.

After clicking the Next button several times, the setup
will then download and install the selected packages (this
may take a while).

Why is this recommended? Cygwin's bash version is required, as no native Win32
version is available. As additional packages can easily be added, Perl and
other packages are also used.

[[ChSetupPowerShell]]

==== Install PowerShell

If you are running Windows Vista you may need to install Windows Powershell 2.0.
You can download it from https://www.microsoft.com/powershell[]

[[ChSetupChocolatey]]

==== Optional: Install Chocolatey

As an alternative to Cygwin you install some packages using
https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey], a native package manager for Windows.
Wireshark's build environment currently supports the _winflexbison_ package but
support for more packages should appear in the future.

// ...such as:
// - Active Perl and/or StrawberryPerl
// - Devbox-UnZip and/or 7zip and/or peazip
// - Wget

[[ChSetupPython]]

==== Install Python

Get the Python 2.7 installer from http://python.org/download/[] and install
Python into the default location ('C:\Python27').

Why is this recommended? Cygwin's Python package doesn't work on some machines,
so the Win32 native package is recommended.

[[ChSetupsubversion]]

==== Install Git

Please note that the following is not required to build Wireshark but can be
quite helpful when working with the sources.

Working with the Git source repositories is highly recommended, see
<<ChSrcObtain>>. It is much easier to update a personal source tree with Git
rather than downloading a zip file and merging new sources into a personal
source tree by hand. It also makes first-time setup easy and enables the
Wireshark build process to determine your current source code revision.

There are several ways in which Git can be installed. Most packages are
available at the URLs below or via https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey].
Note that many of the GUI interfaces depend on the command line version.

===== The Official Windows Installer

The official command-line installer is available at http://msysgit.github.io/.

===== From Cygwin

Cygwin comes with a port of git.  To install it, run Cygwin's
setup-x86.exe or setup-x86_64, navigate to Devel/git, and if the package
has a "Skip" item in the "New" column, click on the "Skip" item so it
shows a version number.

===== Git Extensions

Git Extensions is a native Windows graphical Git client for
Windows.  You can download the installer from
http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/.

===== TortoiseGit

TortoiseGit is a native Windows graphical Git
similar to TortoiseSVN. You can download the installer from
http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/.

===== Others

A list of other GUI interfaces for Git can be found at
http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

==== Install and Prepare Sources

[TIP]
.Make sure everything works
====
It's a good idea to make sure Wireshark compiles and runs at least once before
you start hacking the Wireshark sources for your own project. This example uses
Git Extensions but any other Git client should work as well.
====

// XXX -

. *Download sources*. Download Wireshark sources into
'C:\Development\wireshark' using Git Extensions:

.. Open the Git Extensions application. By default Git Extensions
   will show a validation checklist at startup. If anything needs to
   be fixed do so now. You can bring up the checklist at any time
   via _Tools -> Settings_.

.. In the main screen select _Clone repository_. Fill in the following:
+
Repository to clone: `https://code.wireshark.org/review/wireshark`
+
Destination: Your top-level development directory, e.g. `C:\Development`.
+
Subdirectory to create: Anything you'd like. Usually `wireshark`.
+
[TIP]
.Check your paths
====
Make sure your repository path doesn't contain spaces.
====

.. Click the _Clone_ button. Git Extensions should start cloning the
   Wireshark repository.

. Navigate to your newly cloned directory and open 'config.nmake' in an editor.
  Edit the following settings:

.. `VERSION_EXTRA`: Give Wireshark your "private" version info, e.g.
`-myprotocol123` to distinguish it from official releases.

.. `WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM`: Change to `win64` if you're building
a 64-bit package. You can also define this in the system environment.

.. `PROGRAM_FILES`: Where your programs reside, usually just keep the default:
_C:\Program Files_ footnote:[International Windows might use different values
here, e.g. a German version uses 'C:\Programme' -- take this also in account
where 'C:\Program Files' appears elsewhere.]

.. `MSVC_VARIANT`: Make sure the variant for your compiler is uncommented, and
that all others are commented out. For example, if you're using Visual $$C++$$
2010 Express Edition, find the line
+
--
----
#MSVC_VARIANT=MSVC2010EE
----
and remove the comment character (#) from the beginning of the line. Then, find
the line
----
MSVC_VARIANT=MSVC2010
----
and comment it out, by prefixing a hash (#). footnote:[Compiler dependent: This
step depends on the compiler you are using. For compilers other than Visual
$$C++$$ 2010, see the table at <<ChToolsMSChain>>.]
--

.. `QT5_BASE_DIR`: If you plan to build QtShark (the Wireshark GUI application
which uses the Qt windowing toolkit instead of GTK+), set QT5_BASE_DIR so that
$(QT5_BASE_DIR)/bin/qmake.exe is valid.  You can use the output of
"qmake -query QT_INSTALL_PREFIX" as indicated in the comments in config.nmake,
but make sure that you use backslashes (\\) in the path rather than the forward
slashes returned by qmake.


[[ChSetupPrepareCommandCom]]

==== Prepare cmd.exe

Prepare `cmd.exe` -- set its environment and current directory.

. Start `cmd.exe`.

. Set environment variables for Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Express Edition.
footnote:[International Windows might use different values here, e.g. a German
version uses 'C:\Programme' -- take this also in account where 'C:\Program
Files' appears elsewhere. Note: You need to repeat steps 1 - 4 each time you
open a new cmd.exe.] footnote:[Compiler dependent: This step depends on the
compiler variant used. For variants other than the recommended Visual $$C++$$
2010 Express Edition see the table at <<ChToolsMSChain>>]
+
--
To build 32-bit binaries call
----
> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /Release /x86'
----
and to build 64-bit binaries call
----
> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /Release /x64
----
If your version of the compiler does not have `SetEnv.Cmd` you may need to use
`vcvarsall.bat` or `vcvars32.bat` which do much the same thing as `SetEnv.cmd`.
For example, on some 64-bit installations, one would build a 32-bit version by
invoking
----
> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
----
and one would build a 64-bit version using the command
----
> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\Vcvarsall.bat" amd64
----
Consult your compiler's documentation to learn which version applies to your
installation.
--

. Set environment variable to select target platform.
+
--
To build 32-bit binaries execute
----
> set WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM=win32
----
and to build 64-bit binaries execute
----
> set WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM=win64
----
--


. Run
+
--
----
> cd C:\Development\wireshark
----
to jump into the source directory
--

Wireshark development depends on several additional environment variables,
particularly PATH. You can use a batch script to fill these in, along with the
Visual $$C++$$ variables; a sample script is below.  Note that the paths given
here may not match your installation - double check CYGWIN_BIN and QT5_BIN in
particular, and/or remove QT5_BIN if you are not building QtShark.

----

[[ChToolsWin32Verify]]

==== Verify installed tools

After you've installed the Wireshark sources (see <<ChSrcObtain>>), you can
check the correct installation of all tools by using the `verify_tools` target of
the `Makefile.nmake` from the source package.

[WARNING]
.Dependencies ahead
====
You will need the Wireshark sources and some tools
(nmake, bash) installed, before this verification is able
to work.
====

Enter at the command line (cmd.exe, not Cygwin's bash):

----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake verify_tools
----

This will check for the various tools needed to build Wireshark:

----
Checking for required applications:
        cl: /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/Bin/amd64/cl
        link: /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/Bin/amd64/link
        nmake: /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/Bin/amd64/nmake
        bash: /usr/bin/bash
        bison: /usr/bin/bison
        flex: /usr/bin/flex
        env: /usr/bin/env
        grep: /usr/bin/grep
        /usr/bin/find: /usr/bin/find
        peflags: /usr/bin/peflags
        perl: /usr/bin/perl
        C:\Python27\python.exe: /cygdrive/c/Python27/python.exe
        sed: /usr/bin/sed
        unzip: /usr/bin/unzip
        wget: /usr/bin/wget
----

If you have problems with all the first three items (cl, link, nmake), check
that you called `SetEnv.Cmd` as mentioned in <<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom>>(which
will "fix" your PATHsettings). However, the exact text will be slightly
different depending on the MSVC version used.

Unfortunately, the `link` command is defined both in Cygwin and in MSVC, each
with completely different functionality. You'll need the MSVC link. If your link
command looks something like: `/usr/bin/link` the link command of Cygwin takes
precedence over the MSVC one. To fix this, you can change your `PATH` environment
setting or simply rename `link.exe` in Cygwin. If you rename it, make sure to
remember that a Cygwin update may provide a new version of it.

Make sure that the other tools found are the Cygwin versions. Some build
problems have been caused by incompatible versions of `grep` and `unzip`.

==== Install Libraries

. If you've closed `cmd.exe` prepare it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake setup
----
to download and install libraries using `wget`. This may take a while.
--

. If the download fails you may be behind a restrictive firewall. See the proxy
comment in <<ChToolsWget>>.

Note that 32-bit versions of the software require 32-bit versions of the
libraries and that 64-bit versions require 64-bit libraries. The build process
creates independent directories for each as needed. See
<<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom>>for how to use `SetEnv.Cmd` and
`WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM` to select either a 32- or 64-bit build.

==== Distclean Sources

The released Wireshark sources contain files that are
prepared for a UNIX build (e.g. 'config.h').

You must distclean your sources before building the first time.

. If you've closed `cmd.exe` prepare it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake distclean
----
to cleanup the Wireshark sources.
--

==== Build Wireshark

Now it's time to build Wireshark!

. If you've closed `cmd.exe` prepare it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake all
----
to build Wireshark.
--

. Wait for Wireshark to compile. This will take a while.

. Run `C:\wireshark\wireshark-gtk2\wireshark.exe` and make sure it starts. s

. Open 'Help -> About'. If it shows your "private" program
version, e.g.: Version wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123
congratulations! You have compiled your own version of Wireshark!

TIP: If compilation fails for suspicious
reasons after you changed some source files try to "distclean"
the sources and make "all" again

==== Debug Environment Setup

****
Unfortunately this section hasn't been written. You should be able
to use the Visual Studio debugger to attach to a running executable.
Alternately, if you are building QtShark with Qt Creator, you can
launch QtShark in the debugger included with that IDE.
****

==== Optional: Create User's and Developer's Guide

Detailed information to build these guides can be found in the file
'docbook/README.txt' in the Wireshark sources.

==== Optional: Create a Wireshark Installer

Note: You should have successfully built Wireshark
before doing the following.

If you want to build your own
'wireshark-win32-wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123.exe',
you'll need NSIS.

. NSIS:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net[Download] and install NSIS
+
You may check the `MAKENSIS` setting in the file 'config.nmake' in the Wireshark
sources. Note that the 32-bit version of NSIS will work for both 32-bit and
64-bit versions of Wireshark.

. Runtime redistributable: To build a 32-bit version you will need
'$$vcredist_x86.exe$$':
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328[Download] the
C-Runtime redistributable for Visual
$$C++$$ 2010 Express Edition SP1 (__$$vcredist_x86.exe$$__)
and copy it into 'C:\wireshark-win32-libs'.footnoteref:[compilerdependent,Compiler dependent: This step
depends on the compiler variant used. For variants other than
the recommended Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Express Edition SP1 see the table
at <<ChToolsMSChain>>.]
+
To build a 64-bit version, you will need
_$$vcredist_x64.exe$$_:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523[Download] the 64-bit redistributable for Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Express
Edition SP1 (__$$vcredist_x64.exe$$__) and copy it into
__C:\Wireshark-win64-libs__.footnoteref:[compilerdependent]

. If you've closed `cmd.exe` prepare it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake packaging
----
to build Wireshark installer.
--

. Run
+
--
----
> C:\wireshark\packaging\nsis\wireshark-win32-wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123.exe
----
to test your new installer. It's a good idea to test on a different machine
than the developer machine.
