The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)

* Support has been added for all versions of the DCBx protocol.
* Cleanup of LLDP code, all dissected fields are now navigable.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)

** The Follow Stream dialog now supports packet and TCP stream selection.
** A Flow Graph (sequence diagram) dialog has been added.
** The main window now respects geometry preferences.


The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.10:

* Wireshark now uses the Qt application framework. The new UI should provide
  a significantly better user experience, particularly on Mac OS X and Windows.
* The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of Wireshark
  silently.  You can still run the uninstaller manually beforehand if you wish
  to run it interactively.
* Expert information is now filterable when the new API is in use.
* The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation spans
  (Qt only).
* When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen> and/or
  -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the original frame
  length using the -L option.
* You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times, which
  allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as well as at the end
  of a packet in a single step.
* You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for editcap, which
  allows you to start chopping from that offset instead of from the absolute
  packet beginning or end.
* "malformed" display filter has been renamed to "_ws.malformed".  A handful of
  other filters have been given the "_ws." prefix to note they are Wireshark
  application specific filters and not dissector filters.
* The Kerberos dissector has been replaced with an auto generated one from ASN1
  protocol description, changing a lot of filter names.

The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:

use Lua.


== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
